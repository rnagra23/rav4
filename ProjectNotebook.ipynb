    "For my project, I decided to make a quiz that determines which One Direction member the quiz taker is most compatible with. The code itself uses different functions that contain the questions the quiz taker must answer under a while loop. After answering the question, the function then uses an if loop to direct the quiz taker to the next question. At the end of the quiz, a conditional statement is used to determine which of the five members the quiz taker is most compatible with."
